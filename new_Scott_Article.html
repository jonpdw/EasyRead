            <p>If you want to improve your life, where should you start? <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>Years ago, when I started working on myself, I tried lots of different things. Some helped a lot. But a
                lot didnâ€™t matter. Filtering by trial-and-error works, but it can be slow and discouraging. Knowing what
                I know now, Iâ€™d recommend different practices to my younger self. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>The typical person, if seriously committed, could make enormous improvements in their life in less than a
                year. But only if they build from the right foundation. If youâ€™re interested in building a better life,
                but not sure where to start, here are my recommendations: <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>

            <p>Productivity comes first. The mistake is in thinking that a productivity system is just about getting
                more work done. When in reality itâ€™s about organizing all of your goals and efforts. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>There are two problems people face when it comes to self-improvement: <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>

                    things you think you should. <break time="3s"></break></li>
                <li><audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jmevgv798co1eab/new_list.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <say-as interpret-as="ordinal">2</say-as> point: <break time="500ms"></break> <strong>A failure of follow-up.</strong> You set the intention to exercise every day, but three days
                    later youâ€™ve forgotten about it. <break time="3s"></break></li>
            </ul>
            <p>A productivity system, built correctly, solves both of these problems. It not only helps you keep a
                watchful eye over your limited resources, but it takes over the responsibility of remembering the stuff
                you intended to do. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>The best book on productivity is David Allenâ€™s Getting Things Done. His full system can be a
                bit too elaborate if youâ€™re not a busy executive, but mastering the basics make a big difference. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>

            <p>Regular exercise is the easiest win you can make in your life. Getting exercise regularly has tons of
                health benefits, it makes your mind
                    sharper and improves your mood. And unlike your relationships and career itâ€™s entirely under
                your control. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>While there are many different valid exercise schedules, I recommend starting with one that involves
                exercising every weekday, at the same time each day. Weekdays tend to be more consistent, so if you
                always exercise first thing in the morning, or right after work, it quickly becomes a habit. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>A mistake I made in the beginning was having an inconsistent
                    exercise schedule. I would exercise 3-4 times per week, but not on the same days. The result
                would be that if I skipped a day, it wasnâ€™t necessarily a problem as I could still go tomorrow.
                Unfortunately, that resulted in more skipped days than Iâ€™d like. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>Another problem can be needing 60-90 minutes to exercise. This makes it fall out of your schedule on days
                when you get too busy. I recommend focusing on 20-30 minutes, but of a high enough intensity that you
                get an ideal
                    heart rate. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>

            <p>The most important thing you can do for any goal is to do the work. The second most important thing you
                can do is to read books about how to do it better.  <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>Most of us read far too little. The typical American reads only
                    four books per year. With the right reading practice, you can read that amount each month. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>At minimum, however, you need to put in the time. Thirty minutes a day, especially if it fills the cracks
                in your schedule, is an amount that every person can do. You can definitely commit more, but you
                shouldnâ€™t commit less. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>

            <p>What if I told you that there was a technology that expanded the capacity of your mind. It allowed you to
                instantly offload items from the top of your head to be memorized perfectly, enabled you to see
                connections between items that werenâ€™t visible before, and made you much smarter. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>How much would such a tool be worth to you? <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>Thereâ€™s no sales pitch here, because the technology Iâ€™m discussing is
                    writing. Our working
                    memory, perhaps the major component of intelligence, is fundamentally limited. Writing expands
                this by giving us a buffer to store thoughts before they fall out of our heads. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>Writing also enables self-reflection. You can write down a long series of thoughts and then read
                itâ€”allowing you to simultaneously articulate an idea and critique it. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>All you need to take advantage of this tool is to get a notebook and commit to writing in it at least
                once per week. Write about your current struggles, ambitions or plans. Review your recent days and note
                what went right (or wrong) with your other foundational practices. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>

            <p>The biggest mistake I made in my early self-improvement was that it was too introverted. I exercised
                regularly, kept up my productivity system and read booksâ€¦ except when it came to reaching out to other
                people I fell behind. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>You should set up a time to talk with someone who is ahead of you, in at least one dimension of their
                life, once per week. If youâ€™re working on your career, you should chat with someone who is a few steps
                ahead of you professionally. If youâ€™re working on your health, have a conversation with the person who
                is fit at the gym. If youâ€™re learning something, talk to someone who has done it before. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>The strange thing is, few people do this. They mostly stick with the people they bump into
                accidentallyâ€”colleagues, classmates or random encounters. As a result, they remain limited by the
                knowledge of the people they happen to know. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>

            <p>For years I used to write down on index cards whenever I spent money on anything. When money was tight,
                this practice was essential for getting the most out of it. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>These days, you donâ€™t need anything so tedious. I personally use a spreadsheet that I can quickly review
                and allocate spending into categories, but you can also use personal budgeting applications that will do
                this for you. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>The informal approach, where you only check your bank account balance, is the financial equivalent to
                making decisions about what to work on by how busy you feel. Itâ€™s too crude to make the distinctions you
                need that will actually improve your life. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>Being able to invest in yourself financially can make a big difference. The good life neednâ€™t be
                expensive, but it can be easier to attain if youâ€™re able to budget for it. I always saved money for
                buying books, for instance, even when I was too cheap to eat out. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>

            <p>For many, the major obstacles to the good life arenâ€™t the lack of a desire to change, but the abundance
                of temptations keeping us in the same spot. We watch too much television, play too many videogames,
                scroll Twitter all day. For others it might be drinking, smoking or eating junk food. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>The simplest answer is simply to give all of these up. Abstain from everything that doesnâ€™t make your
                life better. For some vices, this is probably the best answerâ€”especially if you find you use them
                compulsively. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>However, this austere solution may not be appealing or possible in all cases. Iâ€™d like to enjoy the
                occasional glass of wine or watch Netflix, even if I donâ€™t want to be constantly binging either. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>In this case, the foundational practice is setting up fences. Put up barriers that constrain the activity
                within predetermined limits. This can take a variety of forms, but the strength of the fence needs to be
                proportional to the temptation to jump over it: <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>

                    triggering situations that encourage indulgence. â€œI only use social media on weekend mornings.â€� Now,
                    you donâ€™t even think of checking on Wednesday afternoon because it isnâ€™t the context you normally do
                    so. <break time="3s"></break></li>

                    social media websites. Timed switches can turn off electricity to your television outside the hours
                    you want to watch it. <break time="3s"></break></li>

                    friend the password, so you canâ€™t disable it. <break time="3s"></break></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If these last steps donâ€™t keep your indulgence in

            <p>For many, this kind of foundational practice will already be reinforced. If you have kids, or if you work
                in a typical office setting, waking up on time isnâ€™t optional. Yet the tendency to stay up too late, and
                thus being extra tired in the morning can still be a problem. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>However, for students or people who work from home, consistent sleep schedules can be a major life
                upgrade. The reason is simple: consistent sleeping and waking allows you to predictably plan all the
                other things you intend to do. If you wanted to exercise each morning, but you sleep through it some
                days, youâ€™ll never make progress. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>Additional tweaks can make this practice even better: <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>

                    when youâ€™re groggy. <break time="3s"></break></li>

                    However, if you can make it work, a consistent waking schedule is much easier to maintain than one
                    which has you going to bed later and sleeping in on weekends. <break time="3s"></break></li>

            <p>I prefer projects
                    to goals. Goals are helpful, of course, but without a plan theyâ€™re often just fantasies. â€œMake a
                million dollarsâ€� doesnâ€™t help unless it inspires concrete actions. â€œStart saving for retirement by
                putting away 10% of my income each year,â€� works much better. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>Having a big project youâ€™re always working on helps immensely to hold all the other foundational
                practices together. The problem with a lot of self-improvement efforts is that without some big ambition
                that necessitates them, they tend to fall apart in the slack. When you donâ€™t need to wake up on time
                every day, why bother? <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>

            <p>Projects work best when you actually complete them. If youâ€™ve had the habit of starting big efforts and
                not following-through, limit your projects to a couple months in scope at most to begin with. Even now,
                I find projects of 1-2 years to work best to maximize my efforts. Longer-term projects often feel too
                distant to compel motivation. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>

            <p>One problem of productivity is that as you get better at managing your time, you choose activities you
                know are rewarding. The problem is that this â€œlocks inâ€� the range of activities youâ€™ve already
                uncovered. You tend to avoid trying new things that may be a waste of time, because they tend to feel
                lazy or unproductive. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>This isnâ€™t to say that the typical person is spontaneous and adventurous. Quite the oppositeâ€”habits and

                    directly together if you exercise in the morning. Even if you exercise later in the day, they can
                    help synchronize your energy levels throughout the day. Of course, schedule both in your
                    productivity system so you donâ€™t forget. <break time="3s"></break></li>
                <li><audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jmevgv798co1eab/new_list.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <say-as interpret-as="ordinal">3</say-as> point: <break time="500ms"></break> <strong>Third month for reading and journaling.</strong> Thirty minutes a day on the former, at
                    least thirty minutes per week on the latter. Again, this can be part of your productivity system so
                    you donâ€™t forget. The two often synergize as reading exposes you to new ideas, and journaling allows
                    you to retrieve and retain them. <break time="3s"></break></li>

                    invest more time in a serious personal finance planâ€”including making regular savings and budgeting
                    for different life areas. <break time="3s"></break></li>
                <li><audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jmevgv798co1eab/new_list.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <say-as interpret-as="ordinal">5</say-as> point: <break time="500ms"></break> <strong>Fifth month for fencing in vices.</strong> If you feel like you have a lot of compulsive
                    habits that donâ€™t add a lot of value, you may need to shift this up the schedule. However, I
                    recommend putting the emphasis on the positive first, because if you eliminate everything without
                    good alternatives, it may not be stable. You want to feel some pressure from all the things you want
                    to do more of, not just the guilt that you waste too much time. <break time="3s"></break></li>
                <li><audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jmevgv798co1eab/new_list.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <say-as interpret-as="ordinal">6</say-as> point: <break time="500ms"></break> <strong>Sixth month for scheduling conversations and doing new things. </strong>Now that youâ€™ve
                    built the base of a personal system, itâ€™s worthwhile creating more practices that expose you to new
                    opportunities, people and experiences. This tends to work better when you already have most of the
                    other foundational pieces, as new ideas and connections are less valuable if your life is in
                    disarray. <break time="3s"></break></li>
            </ol>
            <p>This six-month process, if undertaken seriously, is itself a kind of project. Thus, once I was done with
                this, starting on a new project might be my goal. Of course, six months is the most optimistic
                timelineâ€”given that real life has plenty of disruptions and setbacks, a year may be more realistic. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
            <p>However, even if it took you five years to build this foundation, it would give you a strong base for
                pursuing any other goal in your life. Whether you want to have a better career, get in really good shape
                or simply be happier, youâ€™d be in the best position to get started. <break time="500ms"></break> <audio src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99psaea4mdemn35/next%20paragraph.mp3?dl=1"></audio> <break time="500ms"></break> </p>
